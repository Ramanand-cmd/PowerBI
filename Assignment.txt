1) What is Power BI and how does it differ from Excel?
ANS:	Both Power BI and Microsoft Excel are data visualization tools that execute similar functions, yet differ in features and applications.
Excel is an excellent tool for small to medium-sized data sets with a lower budget. Whereas, Power bi caters to large data sets, real-time action, and cloud capabilities.


2) Explain the concept of data modeling in Power BI.
ANS:By using text, symbols, and diagrams, data modeling concepts create visual representations of data as it's captured, stored, and used at your business. 
As your business determines how data is used and when, the data modeling process becomes an exercise in understanding and clarifying your data requirement.


3)What are the different types of connections available in Power BI? 
ANS: These Power BI data connection types — Live Connection, Direct Query, and Import - each have unique features and capacities that cater to different 
operational requirements and preferences




4)How do you handle data transformation in Power BI? 
In Power BI, data transformation is primarily managed through the "Power Query Editor," where you can import data from various sources,
clean, reshape, and modify data types before loading it into your analysis by using features like changing data types, removing duplicates,
merging tables, applying calculated columns, and grouping data as needed; essentially allowing you to prepare your data for analysis in the most suitable format. 



5)What is DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) and why is it important in Power BI?
ANS: DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is a formula language used within Power BI that allows users to perform complex calculations and data manipulations 
on their datasets, creating custom measures and calculated columns to extract deeper insights from their data through advanced formulas and functions;
essentially, it's the core mechanism for generating dynamic and insightful analysis within Power BI. 


6)Can you explain the difference between calculated columns and measures in Power BI? 
ANS:A calculated column is evaluated in a row context (row by row, like in an excel table), while a measure is evaluated in the filter context.


7) How do you handle relationships between tables in Power BI?
ANS:To manage relationships between tables in Power BI, you navigate to the "Manage Relationships" option within the Home tab, where you can 
drag and drop columns from one table to corresponding columns in another table, essentially linking them based on a shared identifier like a 
customer ID or product code, creating a visual representation of the relationship between the tables in your data model; this allows you to filter 
data across connected tables based on selections made in one table. 



8)What is the purpose of a Power BI Gateway?
ANS:The Power BI Gateway connects on-premises data sources to Power BI services in the cloud. It acts as a bridge between the two environments, 
allowing users to access and analyze data securely. 



9)How can you schedule data refresh in Power BI Service? 
ANS:Go to the workspace and select a semantic model from the workspace content list. 
On the semantic model details page, select Refresh > Schedule refresh.



10)Explain the concept of row-level security in Power BI. 
ANS:Row-level security (RLS) in Power BI allows you to restrict data access for individual users within a report or dashboard, meaning each user 
can only see data rows that are relevant to their specific permissions, effectively filtering data at the row level based on their role or identity, 
ensuring only authorized data is visible to them; this is achieved by defining security roles and applying DAX expressions to filter data based on user 
attributes like department or location. 


11)What is the Power BI Desktop and how does it differ from Power BI Service?
ANS:Power BI Desktop is a free, downloadable application on your local computer where you create and design reports and dashboards by connecting to data sources,
transforming data, and adding visualizations, while Power BI Service is a cloud-based platform where you publish those created reports, share them with others, 
and collaborate on them in real-time; 


12)Explain the concept of Direct Query in Power BI. 
ANS:DirectQuery is a connectivity mode in Power BI that allows you to extract data directly from database sources like SQL Server and Snowflake.
When you use this mode, Power BI creates schema (metadata) that defines the model structure of the connected source. When you use this data source in a report, 
the model structure is queried for fresh data. This happens every time you navigate or interact with the visuals in your reports.



13) What are Power BI templates and how are they useful? 
ANS: A Power BI template is a pre-designed report layout that acts as a starting point for creating new reports within Power BI, containing elements like visuals,
data model schema, and queries, but without the actual data itself, allowing users to quickly build consistent reports by simply connecting their own data sources 
to the template structure. 



14)How do you handle incremental data refresh in Power BI? 
ANS: To handle incremental data refresh in Power BI, right-click on the relevant table within your data model, select "Incremental Refresh," and then define a 
policy that specifies which data range to refresh each time, allowing you to only update new or modified data since the last refresh, significantly improving 
performance for large datasets. 



15)What is the role of Power Query in Power BI? 
ANS:Power Query is a data transformation and preparation tool in Power BI that allows users to extract, clean, transform, and load (ETL) data from multiple
sources into Power BI for analysis.


16)Explain the difference between calculated columns and calculated tables in Power BI. 
ANS:In Power BI, a calculated column is a new column added to an existing table where each value is calculated based on a formula applied to each row of that table,
while a calculated table is a completely new table created using DAX formulas that can involve filtering, joining, or manipulating data from existing tables in your data model.



17)How do you create custom visuals in Power BI? 
ANS:To create a custom visual in Power BI, you can: 
1.	Set up your environment: Install Node.js, npm, the Power BI CLI, and Developer Visuals tools. 
2.	Create a visual project: Use the Power BI CLI to create a new visual project. 
3.	Design your visual: Use HTML, CSS, and TypeScript to develop your visual. You can also use libraries like D3.js for advanced data visualization. 
4.	Test and debug: Use the Power BI Visuals Playground and the Visual Debugging Tool to test and debug your visual. 
5.	Package your visual: Package your visual as a privy file, which is a zip file that contains all the necessary files and metadata. 
6.	Import your visual: Import the privy file into a Power BI report. 
When designing your custom visual, it's important to consider how it will resize, auto-scale, and how to change its background based on data. 
You can also think about whether the user should be able to choose formatting options. 



18) What are the best practices for optimizing performance in Power BI?
ANS:) Here are some best practices for optimizing performance in Power BI: 
•	Data volume
Large datasets can slow down report performance. Use aggregations to summarize data into tables, which can help Power BI answer queries faster. 
•	Data modeling
Ensure your data model is well-designed, as this can improve performance and make it easier to write DAX measures. 
•	Direct Query mode
This mode is best for large datasets or real-time data, but it can be slower than Import mode. To optimize Direct Query models, use table-level storage. 
•	DAX calculations
Create optimized DAX calculations to improve query performance. Use DAX Formatter to transform raw DAX into readable code. 



19) How can you integrate Power BI with other Microsoft products like Azure and Office 365? 
ANS:Use the "Manage Relationships" dialog to configure relationships and set cardinality correctly. 
•	Report layout
Optimize report layout for mobile devices. 
•	Other best practices
Use white or light background colors, shorten displayed numbers, use tooltips, and use meaningful names for report objects.



20)Explain the concept of aggregations in Power BI.
ANS:Aggregation is the process of combining things. That is, putting those things together so that we can refer to them collectively. 
When you combine values in your data, it's called aggregating. The result of that mathematical operation is an aggregate. When you create visualizations in 
Power BI Desktop and the Power BI service, they may aggregate your data.



21)How do you handle error handling and data quality in Power BI? 
ANS:To handle error handling and data quality in Power BI, you primarily use Power Query transformations to identify and correct data issues during the 
data import process, including data type checks, data validation rules, removing duplicates, handling missing values, and using functions like "Try...Otherwise" 
to manage potential errors, while also implementing data quality monitoring to track and address ongoing issues with your data. 


22) What is the purpose of Power BI Embedded and when would you use it?
ANS:What Is Power BI Embedded?Power BI Embedded is a Microsoft feature that allows developers to integrate interactive Power BI reports, dashboards, and tiles 
directly into their own applications or websites, essentially letting them provide data visualizations within their custom-built software without having to create 
the visuals from scratch; you would use it when you want to incorporate data insights from Power BI directly into a third-party application for your customers or 
internal users to access data analysis within their regular workflow.
